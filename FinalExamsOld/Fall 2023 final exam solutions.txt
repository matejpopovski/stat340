STAT340 Fall 2023 Final Exam Solutions
MC1: c; EX=2, so EX^2=4; E(X^2)=0/8+1/4+4/4+9/4+16/8=22/4, VarX=22/4-16/4=1.5. Var(2x)=4VarX=6
MC2: d; SD=2 or so, n=100, so SD(Xbar)=.2; 95% interval is about 4 standard errors wide
MC3: e; if n is divided by 4, the standard error will be 2x as big
MC4: b; odds = P(fail)/P(succeed)=.01/.99
MC5: d; if at least one is a 3, there are 11 possible pairs. OF those pairs 2 of them add up to 7
MC6: a RSS, b F, c R^2, d TSS, e RMSE
MC7: a; intercept, pH, 2 for roast, 2 for country
MC8: e; all of these could fix the nonlinearity in the residual plot
MC9: c; the green curve has a TPR of about .5 when FPR is .05
MC10: b,e; R^2 will always favor the most complex model. Ridge does not select variables, only shrinks coefficients
SA1a: E(P.hat)=E(X/n)=EX/n= (np)/n=p
   b: Var(P.hat)=Var(X/n)=VarX/(n^2)=np(1-p)/(n^2)=p(1-p)/n
SA2a: P(E)=4/8, P(F)=4/8, P(EF)=3/8 not equal to 4/8*4/8, not independent
   b: P(G)=2/8, P(EG)=1/8 = 4/8*2/8 so yes, independent
SA3a:   Predict 1 | Predict 0
   Y=1 |  8       | 3
   Y=0 |  4       |5
   b: Power = 8/(8+3)
   c: Specificity = 5/(4+5)
   d: Accuracy = (8+5)/(21)
SA4a: sexM, rear.width and the interaction sexM:rear.width are significant
      sexM: male crabs on average have a carapace length 6.72 longer than females, holding other variables constant
	  rear.width: holding other variables constnat, a 1 unit increase in rear.width is associated with an increase of 2.41 crapace length
	  sexM:rear.width: the average effect of rear width is .994 higher for male crabs than for female crabs
   b: -6.73 +/- 2*.96, we are 95% confident that this interval captures the true coefficient value
   c: the model explains 97.05% of the variation in the Y variable 
   d: -1.178 -6.727 + 2.412*10 + .994*10
SA5a: This model has settled on a lambda that has zeroed out species0:rear.width, which wasn't included in the previous model anyway.
   b: Optimal value of lambda is about e^(-5)
   c: Estimated MSE is about 1.5
   d: 1/e is e^(-1) which would have a higher penalty, causing more coefficient shrinkage and more under-fitting.
