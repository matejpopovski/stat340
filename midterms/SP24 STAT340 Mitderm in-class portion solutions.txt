STAT340: Spring 2024 Midterm (In-class) Solutions
MC1: all distribution have a mean of 4
MC2: c; a is a pmf, b is a histogram of sample data, d has connected points which is inappropriate for a discrete distribution
MC3: d
MC4: a, c; The only way for two events to be independent and mutually exclusive is if one of them has Probability zero
MC5: c. P(X<12) is the probability X < mu+sigma = .50 + .34
MC6: a. TP
     b. FN
	 c. TN
	 d. FP
MC7: d, we have never seen any symmetric distributions where values close to zero were evidence of the alternative hypothesis
MC8: A
MC9: E
SA1: Many correct answers. Here are some examples
     a. If there are 10 bird species and they are equally likely to be spotted, let X be the number of the first species observed
	 b. You observe 20 crows. Assuming independence and equal probability, let X be the number of female crows observed out of 20.
	 c. Let X be the number of non-crows spotted before the first crow, assuming independence and constant probability of seeing a crow
	 d. Let X be the weight of the first crow spotted. We could model X using a normal distribution reasonably.
SA2: a. P(Orange | I like it) = 8/(8+4)
     b. A geometric is not appropriate because p changes as you eat candies.
	 c. getting a dark and liking a candy are not mutually exclusive because I like blue, which are also dark.
	 d. P(dark)=16/48, P(like)=12/48, P(dark & like)=4/48 = 16/48*12/48 so yes they are independent events
SA3: a. for Trimax A the type 1 error rate is 9/50
     b. For Trimax B the power is 46/50
	 c. Accuracy of Trimax C is (39+50)/100
	 d. It could be argued that a type 2 error is very bad, and Trimax C has no type 2 errors.
	    Trimax B has highest accuracy which is also desirable.
		It would be hard to argue in favor of Trimax A.
